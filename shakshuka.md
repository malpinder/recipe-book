Contains eggs, chillies, gluten.
For 3 (though for 2, the recipe is basically the same but with fewer eggs & pittas.)

Ingredients
------------
- Olive oil
- 2 or 3 chillies of an appropriate heat (I'm a wimp, so I usually go for the not-at-all-hot ones)
- 1 onion
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 400g tinned tomatoes (whole is best)
- 6 eggs
- Salt (about 1 or 2 grinds)
- 6 pitta breads

Equipment
---------
- Knife & chopping board
- Gloves & second chopping board (for chillies)
- Deep-sided frying pan (with lid)
- A hob
- A toaster or grill

Instructions
------------
Dice onion.
Peel, crush, and slice the garlic. 
Put on gloves. Deseed and finely chop the chillies.

Cook onion and chillies in pan with a generous amount of olive oil on a high heat, until soft & browned.
Add garlic, cumin, paprika, and cook until garlic starts to brown.

Add the tomatoes and salt.
If they're whole, crush them up with a spoon. (I usually fish out any stems or tough nubbins at this point.)
Turn the heat down and simmer for about 15 minutes. It should remain runny. If it gets too thick, add some water.

Make divots evenly in the sauce and crack the eggs into them.
Cover the pan and cook until the eggs are set (about 5 minutes). Baste occasionaly with the sauce so that the tops cook.

While that's happening, heat up the pittas in a toaster or grill.

Dish up in bowls & the pittas on a side plate.
