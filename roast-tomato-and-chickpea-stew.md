- 4 red peppers (or two of the really long ones)
- 1 tbsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 tbsp red wine vinegar
- 1 400g tinned chickpeas, drained & rinsed (keep the brine to do cool stuff with!)
- 1 tsp tomato puree
- 1 preserved lemon
- 1 tsp harissa paste (maybe more or less depending on how spicy you like it)
- 8 pitta breads (optional)

Equipment
---------
- Knife & chopping board
- Baking tray (preferably with deep sides)
- Large saucepan
- A hob
- An oven

Instructions
------------
Preheat oven to 180 degrees.

Chop the tomatoes into wedges and the pepper into roughly similar-sized chunks.
Arrange on a baking tray, wedges facing up.
Drizzle with olive oil, vingear, and scatter cumin seeds and salt.
Roast until soft, for about an hour or maybe longer.

Chop the preserved lemon, discarding the pulp.

Transfer tomato & pepper and the juices into the saucepan.
Add the chickpeas, a little more olive oil, the harissa paste, tomato puree and lemon.
Stir and allow to simmer over a low heat for 15 minutes.

While that's happening, heat up the pittas in a toaster or grill.

Dish up in bowls & the pittas on a side plate.
