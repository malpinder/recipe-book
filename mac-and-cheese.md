One-and-a-bit-pots Mac and Cheese
========
Contains dairy. Meat optional. Gluten optional.
For 3

Ingredients
------------
- 300g small shaped pasta. I like to use use amori; traditional macaroni or bucatti also work great. Penne or farfalle will do in a pinch. In my experience, corn-based pastas will work as a gluten-free option, but rice-based pastas do not.
- 2 cups water
- 1 cup milk
- Salt and pepper
- 100g sharp cheddar cheese (or other strongly flavoured cheese)
- 100g emmental (or other good melting cheese, like mozzarella, fontina or provolone)
- 100g gruyere (or other mild flavoured cheese, like gouda or comte)
- 1 tbsp cornflour
- 60g breadcrumbs (for a gluten-free option, I swear by Esgir crunchy crumbs)
- 1 tbsp butter
- Optional: 70g or so diced pancetta or vegetarian not-bacon

Equipment
---------
- Cheesegrater
- Mixing bowl
- Large saucepan with a lid
- Frying pan
- A hob

Instructions
------------

(If you're confident, you can do these three preliminary steps while the pasta is cooking.)

Grate the cheeses into a mixing bowl. Add cornflour and toss to cover all the cheese.

Melt the butter in a frying pan and add the breadcrumbs, stirring constantly for two to three minutes until they've absorbed all the butter and smell toasty, then remove from the heat.

If using pancetta or not-bacon: remove the breadcrumbs from the pan and fry the meat-or-meat substitute until it's crispy and delicious, then remove that from the heat too.


To cook the pasta:

Add the water and milk to the saucepan with a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper.
Bring to a boil (be careful - boiling milk will bubble and overflow the pan very suddenly. Keep a close eye on it!)

Add the pasta to the pan and stir once so it doesn't stick to the bottom. Turn down the heat until it doesn't threaten to overflow the pan, then cook for 9 minutes.

After 9 minutes, the pasta should be _almost_ cooked. Mix in the grated cheese and cornflour into the pasta and milk water, then cover and leave for another 3 to 5 minutes, until the cheese has melted and the pasta is completely cooked.

Stir one last time to make sure everything's combined, then scoop into bowls. Sprinkle over breadcrumbs and pancetta-or-not-bacon and serve.
