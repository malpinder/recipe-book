Brie and Cranberry Puffs
========
Contains gluten, dairy, egg, nuts

Makes 12

Ingredients
------------
- 1 roll ready-made puff pastry
- Butter or neutral oil (for greaing the pan, about a tablespoon)
- 100g dried cranberries
- 1/2 a jar of cranberry sauce
- 1 wheel of brie
- 50g pecans
- 1 whole egg
- 1 stem fresh rosemary

Equipment
---------
- Knife & chopping board
- 2 small mixing bowls
- A cupcake tin (it's got shallower divots than a muffin tin)
- A pastry brush (it's a stick with rubbery bristles)
- A kettle
- An oven

Instructions
------------
Put the brie in the freezer. Put the dried cranberries in a bowl and cover with hot water. Take the puff pastry out of the fridge. Leave all of these for at least 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 180C.

Butter or oil the insides of the cupcake tin - be really generous to avoid sticking.

Lay out the puff pastry and cut with a pizza cutter or knife into 12 equal-ish sized rectangles. Lay each one in the cupcake tin so the corners stick out over the top - stretching and pulling a bit is fine, but be creaful not to tear! Press the pastry against the pan so it 'sticks' and doesn't fall down into the bottom.

Beat the egg in a small bowl with a tablespoon of water. Brush the pastry generously with the egg using the pastry brush.

Take the brie out of the freezer. Unwrap it and cut it into cubes. I do this by cutting it in half (like a pizza), the each of those in half, then turning it 90 degrees and doing 
the same again. You'll end up probably with 12 reasonably sized cubes and a few smaller corner bits. You can leave those to unfreeze and eat them later.

Put one brie cube in each pastry cup.

Keep back 12 whole pecans and roughly chop the rest. Pluck 12 good-looking rosemary sprigs/leaves and roughly chop the rest too.

Drain the cranberries thoroughly and then mix with the cranberry sauce, chopped pecans, and chopped rosemary. Divide it between all the pastry cups.

Press a whole pecan and a rosemary sprig/leaf into the top of each pile.

Put the tray in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to cool before loosening from the pan with a knife.

These are best warm and reheat well in the oven or microwave.
