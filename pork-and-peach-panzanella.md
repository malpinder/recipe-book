Pork and peach panzanella
========
Contains gluten, dairy, pork (which can probably be subsituted out with veggie chorizo or pulled jackfruit)
For 3

Ingredients
------------

- 3-4 slices of slightly stale bread (depending on the size of the loaf & slices)
- Burrata
- A generous amount of olive oil
- Salt
- 1/2 tsp wholegrain mustard
- 1 tsp capers
- 50g pine nuts
- 2 large ripe peaches
- Enough belly pork for 3 (it'll say on the packet how many it serves)
- 2 sweet cos lettuce
- 1/2 packet rocket
- 4 large basil leaves
- 1 shallot
- 2 tbsp white wine vinegar
- Juice of half a lemon

Equipment
---------
- Knife & chopping board
- Very large mixing bowl
- A small frying pan
- A baking tray
- A roasting pan
- A griddle (it's the rectangular pan with raised ridges)
- A spatula
- An oil brush (it's a stick with rubbery bristles)
- A hob
- An oven

Instructions
------------

Slice the shallot width-ways, to make little rings, as thin as you can.
Put in a bowl or jar with with vinegar, lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Cover and leave while you cook the pork (or substitute).

Cook the belly pork (or your substitute) according to the instructions on the packet. Remember to add salt if it's not pre-seasoned.

Pork will need a resting period of 30 minutes after coming out of the oven; so when it comes out of the oven is when we'll start to cook everything else.

Frst, toast the pine nuts. Heat up the small frying pan (without any oil), then add the nuts. Stir or shake the pan frequently - leaving the nuts still for too long will
let them burn and then you'll have to throw the whole batch out and try again. Once the pine nuts are just starting to darken and are hot to the touch, 
tip them out of the pan onto a plate and put aside for later.

Cut the crusts off the bread and then tear into roughly crouton-sized chunks. Ragged edges and unusual shapes are good, so you can be rough with it.
Put half of them in a very large mixing bowl and set aside.
Spread the other half over a baking tray and cook for 7 minutes, until they've just started to toast.
Once they are cooked, take them out and put them into the large mixing bowl too. You can carry on with the next steps while they're cooking.

Slice the peaches into quarters, and then each quarter into thirds/quarters so you end up with slender wedges.
Asses the number of slices you have and the size of the griddle. You'll almost certainly need to cook them in multiple batches.

Using the oil brush, coat the griddle with about a tablespoon of olive oil. Turn on the heat and let it get really hot. Once the oil is just starting to smoke,
add the peaches flesh-side down. Leave them for two or three minutes without touching them, so they don't stick. Then, as the griddle lines start to form and the peaches soften, flip them
over with the spatula and cook for another few minutes. You'll be able to see when the peaches are done, because they will start to soften and leak juice, and the skin will start to go a little wrinkly.

Once the peaches are cooked, put aside on a plate. Cook any more batches you need to until it's all done.

Rip the basil leaves up and put into the bowl with the bread. Add the rocket. Chop up the cos lettuce width ways (to make it sort-of chunky) and add that to the bowl too.

(Are the toasted croutons done yet? Add them to the bowl too.)

Mix up a dressing with some olive oil, the brine from the shallot, and the mustard and capers. Pour 3/4 of it over the bread and leaves and toss throughly.

Slice up the belly pork.

To assemble everything, first add the mixed leaves and bread to the plates. Scatter over the toasted pine nuts and the pickled shallot. Add the peaches, then the pork.
Tear the burrata into rough chunks (about the same size as the croutons) and scatter that over, too. Add more dressing to taste, then serve.
