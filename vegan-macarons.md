Instructions
------------

If you've got chickpea water directly from the can, you'll need to render it down first. Simmer in a pan, stirring occaisionally, until it's roughly halved in volume. It should be roughly the consistency of old egg whites - runny, but still able to coat the back of a spoon. Leave it to cool - it will thicken up even more, to roughly the consistency of fresh whites or yolks. Measure out 70g of this thicker water.

Sieve together the ground almonds and icing sugar. Try to get out all the actual lumps - there will be some grounds left in the sieve no matter how hard you try, because of how almonds work; just chuck them in too. Add the freeze-dried raspberries, food colouring, and exactly half of your chickpea water. Mix it together until it forms a (probably very stiff) paste.

Put the other half of the chickpea water in the spectacularly clean mixing bowl, and whisk until it's reached stiff peaks. (This will take about 2 to 3 times as long as it would for egg whites.)

While it's whisking, make a sugar syrup.
