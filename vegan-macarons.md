Vegan Raspberry Macarons (Italian method)
========
Contains chickpeas.
Involves hot sugar syrup. Hot syrup is VERY hot and VERY sticky and VERY dangerous.
Makes 15

Ingredients
------------
- 100g ground almonds
- 90g icing sugar (powdered sugar)
- 10g freeze-dried or powdered raspberries
- 70g chickpea water, rendered - roughly the amount from 2 tins of chickpeas
- 70g sugar
- 20g water
- Pink gel or powder food colouring (not oil-based!)
- Another 30g or so of icing sugar
- 1tbsp Vegan / dairy-free margarine spread stuff
- a handful of fresh raspberries

Equipment
---------
- 2 mixing bowls (one must be spectacularly clean)
- Electric mixer of some kind
- 1 baking tray
- Greaseproof/silicon paper
- Piping bag
- Saucepan
- Sugar thermometer
- A hob
- An oven

Instructions
------------

If you've got chickpea water directly from the can, you'll need to render it down first. Simmer in a pan, stirring occaisionally, until it's roughly halved in volume. It should be roughly the consistency of old egg whites - runny, but still able to coat the back of a spoon. Leave it to cool - it will thicken up even more, to roughly the consistency of fresh whites or yolks. Measure out 70g of this thicker water.

Sieve together the ground almonds and icing sugar. Try to get out all the actual lumps - there will be some grounds left in the sieve no matter how hard you try, because of how almonds work; just chuck them in too. Add the freeze-dried raspberries, food colouring, and exactly half of your chickpea water. Mix it together until it forms a (probably very stiff) paste.

Put the other half of the chickpea water in the spectacularly clean mixing bowl, and whisk until it's reached stiff peaks. (This will take about 2 to 3 times as long as it would for egg whites.) Don't overwhisk, try not to let it stand while you do the next step.

While it's whisking, make a sugar syrup. Put the sugar and water in a pan, gently boil without stirring until the sugar thermometer reads 245F or 120C - the soft ball stage. Turn your mixer to low speed (to avoid splashing) and pour in the syrup. A bunch will stick to the sides and the whisk, that's ok.

Turn the mixer back up to high and whisk until it's glossy, white and considerably thicker - it should fill up the balloon of the whisk and not drip out. Scoop it out into the almond paste mixture.

Stir together until the mixture is all the same consistency, like a thick grainy batter. Then, macaronnage - squash/smear the mixture against the side of the bowl, scoop it up, turn the bowl around, and repeat 15-20 times. (You're trying to get most of air out of the mixture so that the macarons will be chewy, not crispy like meringue.)

Fill a piping bag with the mixture. Put the paper on a baking tray and pipe dollops about the size of a pound coin. Pipe from the top to keep them round, then pat down any 'tufts' with a wettened finger. Leave to set for about an hour - the surface should be tacky, but not sticky.

Pre-heat the oven to 140C. Bake the macarons for 20 minutes - you might need to turn them around halfway through if your oven has hot and cold spots. Remove from the oven, take the paper off the tray and leave to cool.

Once cooled, I find they often stick to the paper. Turn it all over, brush the back of the paper with warm water using a pastry brush, and they'll peel off. Keep in an airtight container until you're ready to assemble.

Make the icing by adding the dairy-free spread, half of the icing sugar and fresh rasberries and mix until it forms a paste. Add more icing sugar until the consistency is correct - thick, but not stiff or powdery; wet, but not oily.

Put the icing into your piping bag and pipe a layer onto a macaron shell. Take another shell of roughly the same size, squeeze it on gently. Repeat for all the other shells. Leave the macarons in an airtight container for at least 24 hours, ideally 48, for the moisture to spread evenly throughout.
