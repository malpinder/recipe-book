Asparagus panzanella
========
Contains gluten, dairy (optionally; parmesan makes this non-vegetarian).
For 2

Ingredients
------------
- A generous amount of olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2-4 slices of good quality bread (depending on the size of the loaf & slices)
- Salt
- Grated parmesan or cheddar (optional)
- 1/2 tsp dijon mustard
- 2 large leeks
- 1 packet asparagus (about 250g, I think)
- 1 tin cannellini beans, drained & rinsed (you can substitute any kind of white bean and it should work fine)

For the picked onion:
- 1/2 red onion
- 2 tbsp white wine vinegar
- Juice of half a lemon

I often make extra onion (to use up an entire onion and entire lemon) and then keep the leftovers covered in the fridge.

Equipment
---------
- Knife & chopping board
- 2 baking trays
- Saucepan
- A hob
- An oven

Instructions
------------

Slice the red onion (as fine as you can).
Put in a bowl or jar with with vinegar, lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Cover and leave for at least 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.

Peel, crush and roughly chop the cloves of garlic.
Remove crusts from bread and dice into rough cubes.
Toss with enough olive oil to lightly coat, the garlic, a pinch or two of salt, and the parmesan if using.
Spread out over a baking tray and cook until toasted, turning often.
(Once they are cooked, take them out and put them aside - they will wait until the rest of the salad is ready)

While the croutons cook, slice the leeks lengthways to the center (as if you were cutting them in half from top-to-bottom, but only on one side of the leek).
Rinse, cut into batons an inch or two long.
Trim the asparagus and save the stems if the bottoms are too woody. Chop into similar sized batons to the leek.
Put in a baking tray, mix up with some olive oil. Cook until soft, about 15 minutes.
(Don't worry if some of the leek goes paper-crunchy, just pick those bits out.)

Mix up a dressing with some olive oil, the brine from the onions, and the mustard.

Toss the leek, asparagus, beans, red onion and croutons with dressing and serve.
