========
Contains pork, beef, milk, alcohol, celery.
For 4

Ingredients
------------
- Some butter or olive oil
- 100g smoked, fatty bacon (streaky or lardons)
- 1 large onion
- 1 large carrot
- 2 sticks celery
- 200g beef mince
- 150ml milk or cream
- 150ml white wine
- 400g tinned tomatoes (whole is best)
- 3 tsp tomato puree
- 300g pasta (dry weight; I use penne)
- Cheese (cheddar or parmesan) (optional)

Irritatingly, it's hard to find 100g of bacon or 200g of mince, so I normally make double and freeze the leftovers.

Equipment
---------
- Knife & chopping board
- Hob-proof casserole dish (with lid)
- Saucepan
- A hob
- An oven

Instructions
------------
Dice the onion, celery and carrot.

Fry the bacon in your fat of choice on a high heat.
Add onion; cook until softened and then add the carrot and celery.
Cook for a few minutes until that's started to soften too.
Add the mince, make sure it's broken up and not in lumps. Cook until all the water's cooked off and the meat has turned brown.

Preheat oven to 125 degrees.
Add the milk. Turn down the heat and simmer gently until almost dry again (about 20 minutes).
Add the wine, tomatoes and puree. Stir. Put the lid on but slightly ajar, and put in the oven for at least 2 hours, ideally 3 or 4.

Later: Bring water to the boil, cook pasta to your desired level of softness (about 12-15 minutes).
Drain pasta, serve in bowls. Grate over cheese if you'd like.
