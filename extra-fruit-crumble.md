Contains gluten, dairy. nuts

For 4

Ingredients
------------
- 4 bramley apples or other cooking apples (eating apples won't work!)
- 8 soft dried apricots
- 150g blackberries (fresh or frozen)
- 50g golden raisins or sultanas
- 1/2 lemon
- 1 tablespoon soft brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon(!) ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon plain or wholemeal flour (for the filling)
- 200g plain or wholemeal flour (for the crumble)
- 100g cold butter
- 100g brown sugar
- 100g walnuts
- A pinch of salt (about 1/4 teaspoon)

Equipment
---------
- Knife & chopping board
- Zester, microplane or other grater
- Cup or bowl or small strainer (for the lemon juice)
- 2 large mixing bowls (or 1 if you don't mind washing it out between steps)
- Vegetable peeler
- Large round casserole dish
- Mini blender (optional but it makes chopping the walnuts easier)
- Butter knife (for the butter) and tablespoons for measuring
- An oven

Instructions
------------
Preheat oven to 170 degrees.

Peel the apples. Chop them in half and then into quarters so you can cut out the core, then cut the quarters into thirds to make slices.

Add the apples to the large mixing bowl.

Add the blackberries and raisins. Finely dice the apricots and add those too.

Zest the lemon into the bowl too. Juice the lemon into a separate bowl or cup so you can pick out the seeds, and then add it to the bowl, or juice it driectly into the bowl through a strainer.

Add the cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of flour.

Mix everything together thoroughly enough that the flour is incorporated and every apple slice is covered, but not so thoroughly that the blackberries get completely mashed.

Pour all that into the casserole dish and leave it while you make the topping.

(Wash out the bowl if you're only using 1.)

Add the butter to the mixing bowl. Chop it roughly into chunks about a cm across using a butter knife.

If you've got a mini blender, add the walnuts and pulse until they're mostly ground (but still have some chunky bits). If you don't have a mini blender, you'll need to roughly chop the walnuts with a knife.

Add the walnuts to the bowl with the butter. Add the flour and sugar and the pinch of salt too.

Using your hands, rub the butter into the dry mixture until it forms a sort-of pebbly mix and all the butter is incorporated.

If you aren't sure if it's all mixed yet, give the bowl a quick shake side to side for a few seconds - any large bits of butter will rise to the top.

Sprinkle the mixture over the top of the fruit in the casserole dish.

Put it in the oven for 40 minutes.

After it's done, take it out of the oven and leave it to cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.
