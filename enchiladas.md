========
Contains dairy. Meat optional. Onion optional.
For 4

Ingredients
------------
- 3-5 dried chillis, type and amount depending on heat preference (I usually use a mix of ancho, guajillo and chipotle)
- Boiling water
- 1 500g pack of passata
- 2 tbsp tomato puree
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp paprika
- up to 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, depending on heat preference
- between 1 to 5 tsp from a jar of ancho chili in adobo sauce
- a pinch of salt
- Olive oil and vegetable oil
- 2 large onion
- 2 red bell peppers
- 2 courgettes
- 1x 150g tin sweetcorn
- 1 tin black beans
- 12 (1 pack) soft corn tortillas
- 150g or so cheddar cheese or montery jack, grated (lactofree works fine)

If cooking with meat:
- 2 chicken breasts or legs
- 1 chicken stock cube
- More boiling water

Equipment
---------
- Knife & chopping board
- Gloves (if you are prone to chili burn)
- Blender, blitzer or other pureeing device
- Small saucepan
- Frying pan
- A whole bunch of bowls and plates for prepared ingredients to sit in
- An oven dish or baking pan with tall sides that will fit all your rolled-up tortillas comfortably
- A hob
- An oven

If cooking with meat:
- A second frying pan with tall sides, large enough for the chicken

Instructions
------------
First prepare the sauce. (Use gloves and a different knife and chopping board while handling chillis, if you get chilli burn like I do.)
Remove the stems and all the seeds from the dry chillis and throw them away.
Slice or tear the dried chillis into roughly postage stamp sized pieces (it doesn't need to be exact).
Add them to the dry frying pan (that means without any water or oil), turn the heat up to medium-to-high, and stir and shake them around constantly
until it starts to smell pungent and aromatic, maybe 2 to 3 minutes.
Turn off the heat. Pour over enough boiling water to cover the chilis, then leave to rehydrate for 10 minutes.
Then, add the chilis and liquid to your blender/blitzer/whatever and puree to a reasonably smooth goop.

Add the chilli goop to a small pan with the passata, tomato paste, oregano, chilli powder, chilli flakes, red pepper flakes, cinnamon, paprika, adobo paste, cayenne, and a pinch of salt.
Stir and heat through, taste for seasoning. (Vegetable stock, soy sauce, onion-infused oil, marmite and/or miso paste can help if it's a bit too sweet or bland, but check for allergens.)
The sauce is done! Leave it on the side while you do everything else, it will happily wait for even a day or two in the fridge.

All the vegetables listed are optional, and can be replaced by pretty much anything you prefer. (The amounts listed above assume all 4 people are having everything; you might have to do some maths, sorry.)
- If using onions: slice into strips, gently fry in a little olive oil until starting to turn brown, then put to the side.
- If using courgette: slice into coins, quarter, fry in a little olive oil until starting to turn brown, then put to the side.
- If using bell pepper: slice into strips, fry in a very tiny amount of vegetable oil until they soften and start to char, then put to the side.
- If using black beans: drain and rinse the beans.
- If using sweetcorn: drain the water from the can. If you feel fancy, char them: add to a dry pan (without oil or water) and cook on medium heat, stirring occasionlly until they start to blacken. (This'll usually leave a load of gunk stuck to the pan you'll need to wash off.)

If cooking with meat:
Take a spoonful of the chilli sauce and add it to the second frying pan. Add a chicken stock cube and about a pint of hot water and stir to dissolve.
Add the chicken to the sauce and simmer for about 10-20 minutes (depending on how big the chicken is), turning the chicken over now and then to make sure it's all saucy.
Once the chicken's cooked through, remove from the sauce and shred with two forks. Place in a bowl, add four tablespoons of the poaching sauce, and mix together. (If you _aren't_ making a separate vegetarian version at the same time, you can mix this liquid back into the other sauce for extra flavour, but otherwise, discard it.)

*Assembly:*

Turn on the oven to 200C.
Check your frying pan is clean and dry (and doesn't need any oil washing out of it).
Over a high heat, briefly warm each tortilla so they won't break when you roll them.
Add a generous few tablespoons of the sauce to the base of the baking dish and smear it about a bit.


To assemble an enchilada: dip the warm tortilla in the sauce so it's coated. Add whichever various filling vegetables and meats you want. Add a little grated cheese. Add extra adobo sauce, chilli oil and/or cayenne pepper if you want more spice.
Then roll, and place in the baking dish seam-side down.


Once all your enchiladas are in place, pour over any remaining chili sauce and top with the remaining cheese. (Grate more if there's not enough, it should be a generous layer.)
Place the dish in the hot oven for 20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly and everything is hot through.
Scoop the echiladas out of the baking dish and serve on plates.
