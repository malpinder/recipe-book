- 1 tbsp salt
- Olive oil
- 15g butter or 2 tbsp oil

Equipment
---------
- Mixer with a dough hook (optional)
- Mixing bowl
- Measuring jug
- Small bowl
- Cling film
- Teatowel
- Somewhere warm
- Baking tray
- Oven
- Pastry brush (optional)

Instructions
------------

First, activate the yeast. (I advise doing this with any dried yeast, even the "instant" stuff). 

A note on water temperature: It should feel neither hot nor cold. Yeast, like you, wants to be warm, but not cooked. If you've got a thermometer, you're aiming for 32 degrees. Otherwise, dip in your elbow - hands (or mine at least) run colder than other body parts and so they'll skew the reading.

Get your properly-calibrated 150ml warm water and mix in the teaspoon of sugar, then the yeast. Stir it so there's no big clump (it'll be a bit clumpy, that's fine), then leave it to wake up for 10 minutes or so. If it starts foaming a lot, stir it so it calms down.

Mix the flour, remaining tablespoon of sugar, and salt in your mixing bowl. Add either the butter or oil and stir roughly. Pour in the yeast water, mix until it's started to form a dough.

It will almost certainly be too dry to stick together and full of loose flour still. Add a bit of the reserved water, then mix, then more water, then mix, until it comes together to form a dough. Don't pour in too much at a time or you'll get soup.

My trick for great bread - it took me ages to get the confidence to make my dough wet enough! Dough that is really damp and sticky will often 'dry up' during kneading. Drier dough is okay but you'll get tough bread.

Knead. I use a machine because I like my hands. Stop once the dough has become smooth, stretchy and even. (The type of flour you use will change the texture of the dough, I use super super strong flour and I can tell when it's done kneading because it becomes incredibly soft and silky.)

Take the dough out of your bowl, if you were using a machine. Take the bowl and oil it - you can use more butter, but I use olive oil because I'm lazy. Ball up the dough and put it in. Cover the bowl loosely with clingfilm, then a teatowl. Put it in the warm place and leave it for an hour.

Optional: second proving. Once it's risen, pick it up and knock it about until most of the air's gone, then leave it to prove again. Results in a slightly-less-sweet, sturdier bread, better for slicing loaf-style.

After either one or two provings, pre heat the oven to 190C. Knock the dough back, tear it into roughly even portions (4 or 6 or maybe even 8) and roll them about between your palms so there's no obvious seams or clefts. Sprinkle (a generous amount of) flour over the baking tray, or use silicon paper, and arrange the buns on it.

Optional: brush with milk or water for a softer crust.

Cook at 190C for 12 to 15 minutes (depending on bun size - fewer, bigger buns will take on the longer end). Check they are done by tapping on the underside with a utensil or knuckle - it should sound hollow.
